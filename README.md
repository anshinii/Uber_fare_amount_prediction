Uber Fare Amount Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Regression Project
This project aims to predict the fare amount of Uber rides based on key trip features such as pickup/dropoff coordinates,
passenger count, and trip distance. Using regression algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, 
I developed a model capable of predicting fares with high accuracy. After preprocessing and feature engineering, 
the best-performing model achieved an RÂ² score of 0.88+, making it highly effective for estimating fare prices. 
The project is also deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app, hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, allowing users 
to input ride details and get real-time fare predictions.
